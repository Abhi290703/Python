1.what is python ?
python is high-level programming language 
where python is a interpreted language where each and every line code will be executed before
turning into machine code

2.why python is hybrid language ?
python is hybrid language because first it compiles into byte code and then it interpets bytecode at 
runtime.

3.Their are 3 types of centeric
    1.functional :
        a.program is oraginized has collections of Functions where each function performs specific task
        b.it doesn't change globaly 
    2.data :
        a.it is used store data,access and manipulation of data
        b.it is used databases , data analysis and file handiling
    3.module :
        a. is to separate related logic into different files.
        b.Each module handles one part of the system â€” easier to maintain and reuse.

4.Datatypes in python
    1.Numeric
        a.int
        b.float
        c.boolean
        d.complex
    
    2.Sequentical
        a.list
        b.tuple
        c.string
        d.array
        e.bytearray

    3.sets
        a.set

    4.dist
        a.dictonary

what are the fratures of the python ?
simple,
easy to write,
interpreted,
dynamici,
object oriented,
platform independent,
scripting language,
scable

what is mean variables ?
variables are used to data or values to it.where we change the values while execution of the programs

what is mean by literal ?
we can declare the values directly into the variables is knows has literals.

How many types of converstions are their ?
1.implict conversition
2.explict converstion

Implict Converstion :
1.int
2.float
3.complex
4.boolean

Explict Converstion :
1.tuple
2.list
3.string
4.array
5.bytearray

what are primitive data type and non-primitive data type

primitive data type :
int
float
boolean
string
complex

Non-primitive data type:
list
tuple
sets
dictonary
array

 what are type conversition :
 int float boolean string complex

 int() :
 we can convert any type of datatype into int except complex but only valid strings can be converted
 eg : a = 12.56 int(a) = 12
 eg : b = true int(b) = 1

float() :
float can convert all other into float except complex
eg : a = 12 float(a) = 12.00
eg : b = true float(b) = 1.0

boolean() :
by passing any variable it will convert into true except false

string():
string can change any type of variables
eg : a = 10 str(a) = '10'
eg : b = 12.34 str(b) = '12.34'

Quadratic Equation :

x = +-b root(b^2 - 4ac)/2a

string concatation :
By using "+" we can add the both the operators by concatation
eg : a = 'abc'
     b = 'def'
     c = a + b

string Repetation :
by using "*" we can repeat the value how many times we can
eg : a = 5
     b = a * 5 // aaaaa

chain comparison :
chain comparison operator allows multiple values to it
eg :  a < b < change
 x = 15
 if 10 < x < 20:
    print("it is a correct")
else :
    print("it is wrong")

Inqury methods : inqury methods either returns true or false
isalpha
islower
isupper
isdigit
isalnum
isspace
istitle

Formating Printing :
ASCII : American standed of code information interchange
A-Z : 65 - 90
a-z : 97-122
0-9 : 48-57

Formatted Printing : printing a meaning statement is called formatting printing
%s
%f
%i
%o
%x
%d
%g
%E

in list :
list are heterogenous elements list are mutable where any type of elements in the list
list are creation []
Adding elements in list are :
append
extend
insert
copy

Removing elements from list :
remove
pop
clear
del()

sets : sets is mutable 
in sets the order of elements are in unorder form
set operations :
add()
remove()
update()

types of sets :
set() , poperset(), propersubset(), disjointset(), 

union : all the elementsfrom both a and b will be written values
intersection : all the common elements from both a and b will be written
Difference : 
only distinct values from "A" will be sorted from B-A
only distinct values from "B" will be sorted from A-B

dictonary : it is a collections of homogenious elements and it is mutable it accepts any type of elements
in dictonary key and values pairs can be any type

operations :
add() , update() , write()

zip functions : it combines both values into zip format
 methods in dictonary :
 keys()
 values()
 items()
 get()
 set default()
